# Design Challenge

### Objective:
Visually distinguish an interactive overlay from the content.

### Variables:
- User input detected
- User Awareness

### Solutions:

#### Add visual effects over the content to constraint visibility
By adding an effect, we reduce visibility limiting focus and attention to the content.  

Effects: 
- Lightbox
- Blurring

#### Promote attention to interactive overlay by using different **highlight** colors schemes from content

#### Promote attention to interactive overlay by using animation on element transition and container 

#### Promote attention to interactive overlay by using visual segregations
Using borders, shadow effects.

#### Use interactive elements to toggle interactive overlay and promote awareness interactive overlay
Having a interactive element like a button/toggle would trigger a user's initial interaction.
After initial interaction, user acquires awareness that the fully expanded content is interactive.

#### Use a dialog/prompt on first visit to promote awareness of the interactive overlay
- Capture attention using colors, motion and sounds
- Disable after initial acknowledgement
